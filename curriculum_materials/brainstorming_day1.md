# Brainstorming for developing materials

Breast cancer, case study


### Learning objectives: 

-tools
  - Use NCBI website to identify databases relevant to the study at hand.

- mutations (BRCA1)
  - Use	NCBI tools to	analyze	protein primary	sequence	and	structure.
  - Evaluate the relative contribution of mutations in tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes in the development of cancer.
  - Describe how mutations arise and how environmental factors can increase mutation rate.
  - Predict the most likely effects on protein structure and function of null, reduction-of-function, overexpression, dominant-negative and gain-of-function mutations.
  - Compare the role of both loss and gain of function mutations in the origin of tumors.

- function of proteins
  - Predict	the	effects	of	mutations	on	the	activity,	structure	or	stability	of	a	protein	and	design	appropriate	experiments	to	assess	the	effects	of	mutations.

- techniques for diagnosis of breast cancer

- staging and grading
- subtypes
  - Discuss	the	interactions	between	a	variety	of	biological molecules	(including	proteins,	nucleic	acids,	lipids,	carbohydrates	and	small	organics,	etc.)	and	describe	how	these	interactions	impact	specificity	or	affinity	leading	to	 changes	in	biological	function
  - Predict	the	effects	of	either	mutation	or	ligand	structural	change	on	the	affinity	of	binding	and	design	appropriate	experiments	to	test	their	predictions.

- treatments
  - Explain	how	computational	approaches	can	be	used	to	explore	protein-ligand	interactions	and	discuss	how	the	results	of	such	computations	can	be	explored	experimentally
  - Compare	and	contrast	the	computational	approaches	available	to	propose	a	three	dimensional	structure	of	a	macromolecule	and	discuss	how	the	proposed	structure	could	be	validated	experimentally.
  - Analyze	kinetic	or	binding	data	to	derive	appropriate	parameters	and	assess	the	validity	of	the	model	used	to	describe the	phenomenon.
