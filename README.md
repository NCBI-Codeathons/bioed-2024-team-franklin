# Project Summary
-The project is designed to be a case study investigating how cancer subtypes have substantial effect on the clinical manifestation of breast cancer and subsequent treatment. By investigating and comparing the molecular genetics of two patients, students investigate current treatment protocols and further identify patients't gene variants with NCBI tools and recognize the biological mechanism of how specific mutations effect clinical treatment outcomes with particular attention to how biological race may have role in creating personalized medecine. The project is intended for advanced level high school students and undergraduates with a core understanding of general biology along with strong unstanding central dogma and basic genetics.

# Curricular Package Details
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.
Students should be able to generate understanding of cancer substypes such as triple negative vs triple postive and associated treatment protocols.
Students should be able to generate basic understanding of how cancer type diagnosis will affect treatment protocol.
Students should be able to explain how of gene variations will affect treatment outcome.
Student should be able to recognize the consideration of how race effects treatment outcomes


## Learning Objectives
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.
-Explain the molecular classification of breast cancer into subtypes such as hormone receptor-positive (ER/PR+), HER2+, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
-Understand the significance of biomarkers such as estrogen receptor(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 in breast cancer classification and how the clinical diagnosis will changes treatment protocol. 
-Recognize gene variants and connect Blast 


## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).
The case study is currently being developed most likely as a PDF file. 

## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).
Within the case study format student will be expected to generate graph and recognize the clinical significance of the data.
Understanding the signifance of the data, will require the students to analyze, how typical treatment protocol may effect outcome

## Future Work
Optional section. Briefly mention any potential future development plans for the curriculum package.
