## Project Summary
In Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), the absence of Androgen Receptor (AR) expression, alongside estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, defines the aggressive "quadruple negative" subtype. AR-negative TNBC, particularly prevalent among African American women, is associated with a poorer prognosis due to enriched basal and immune signatures. This case study, designed for high school and undergraduate students, highlights the importance of including AR status in breast cancer classification. AR acts as a critical prognostic marker and a potential target for immune-based therapies. Utilizing NCBI tools such as ClinVar, PDB, BLAST, PubMed, ICn3D and GEO databases can help students explore ARâ€™s role in TNBC and guide the development of more personalized and effective treatment strategies.


## Prerequisite knowledge for students
Ideally, students should meet the following prerequisites prior to using the case study: 
- Have fundamental knowledge on Biology, especially Molecular Biology.
- Have had a brief introduction into Cancer Biology.
- Have had a brief introduction into gene expression/genome analysis.
- Know the technologies needed to determine gene expression and other fundamental techniques used in diagnostics.
- Have been introduced to basics of experimental design.
- Design an experiment to test a hypothesis (skill).

## Learning objectives
Following the completion of the case study, students should be able to: 
1. Have an understanding of cancer subtypes and how treatment protocols are selected for each subtype.
2. Be able to describe how molecular genetics influences disease progression and treatment outcomes, with a consideration of racial factors.
3. Explain the significance of structural and expression gene variations in shaping treatment responses and disease outcomes in breast cancer.
4. Utilize a variety of NCBI tools such as ClinVar, PDB, BLAST, ORFfinder, and ICn3D for in-depth genomic analysis and interpretation in breast cancer research.
5. Advocate for the importance of genetic analysis in developing personalized medicine.
6. Appreciate the importance of Genomics to science and society at large.

## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).
The case study is currently being developed most likely as a PDF file with a modular format. The modules can be utilized in sequence or several modules may be selected as needed to create a project appropriate for various levels of students with varying levels of depth.  

## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).
To evaluate student learning, we will use quizzes to test understanding of AR in TNBC and NCBI tools, tests for detailed concepts and data interpretation, and practical assessments to apply findings to case studies. This approach ensures a thorough evaluation of both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## Future Work
Optional section. Briefly mention any potential future development plans for the curriculum package.
