# Project Summary
-The project is designed to be a case study investigating how breast cancer subtypes have substantial effect subsequent treatment. By investigating and comparing the molecular genetics of two patients, students investigate current treatment protocols and further identify patients' gene variants with NCBI tools and recognize the biological mechanism of how specific mutations effect clinical treatment outcomes with particular attention to how biological race may have a role in creating personalized medicine and may change the paradigm of cancer subtypes. The project is intended for advanced level high school students and undergraduates with a core understanding of general biology along with strong unstanding central dogma and basic genetics.


# Curricular Package Details
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.
1. Students should have understanding of cancer subtypes and how treatment protocols for each subtype.
2. Students should be able to explain how of existing and novel gene variations have a mechanism effect on treatment outcomes. 
3. Students should be able to utilize the NCBI tools such BLASTn, GenVar, CN3D to generate understanding of the molecular genetics of the variations for each patient.
4. Students should be able to recognize the novel subtype of Quadruple Negative Breast Cancer with respect to biological race and the implications for personalized medicine. 




## Learning Objectives
List the specific learning goals students will achieve with this curriculum.
-Explain the molecular classification of breast cancer into subtypes such as hormone receptor-positive (ER/PR+), HER2+, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
-Understand the significance of biomarkers such as estrogen receptor(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 in breast cancer classification and how the clinical diagnosis will changes treatment protocol. 
-Recognize gene variants and connect Blast 


## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).
The case study is currently being developed most likely as a PDF file with a module format. The modules acan be utilized in sequence or several modules may be selected as needed create an appropriately level project for various levels of student with varying levels of depth.  

## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).
Within the case study format student will be expected 

## Future Work
Optional section. Briefly mention any potential future development plans for the curriculum package.
