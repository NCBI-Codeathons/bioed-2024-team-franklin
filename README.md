## Project Summary
AR-negative triple negative or “quadruple negative” breast cancers in African American women exhibit enriched basal and immune signatures, indicating poorer prognosis. The absence of Androgen Receptor (AR) expression in these cases is prevalent among African American women and correlates with aggressive characteristics. AR expression serves as a prognostic marker and a potential candidate for immune-targeted therapies, particularly in African American women with breast cancer. This case study (meant for advanced high school and undergraduate students of all levels) advocates the need of including AR to the current set of ER, PR, and HER2 markers for breast cancer classification and suggests exploring the link between AR loss- or gain-of-function and ancestry markers for enhanced treatment strategies. 

## Prerequisite knowledge for students
Ideally, students should meet the following prerequisites prior to using the case study: 
- Have fundamental knowledge on Biology, especially Molecular Biology.
- Have had a brief introduction into Cancer Biology.
- Have had a brief introduction into gene expression/genome analysis.
- Know the technologies needed to determine gene expression and other fundamental techniques used in diagnostics.
- Have been introduced to basics of experimental design.
- Design an experiment to test a hypothesis (skill).

## Learning objectives
Following the completion of the case study, students should be able to: 
1. have an understanding of cancer subtypes and how treatment protocols are sekected for each subtype.
2. be able to describe how molecular genetics influences disease progression and treatment outcomes, with a consideration of racial factors.
3. explain the significance of structural and expression gene variations in shaping treatment responses and disease outcomes in breast cancer.
4. utilize a variety of NCBI tools such as ClinVar, PDB, BLAST, ORFfinder, and ICn3D for in-depth genomic analysis and interpretation in breast cancer research.
5. advocate for the importance of genetic analysis in developing personalized medicine.
6. appreciate the importance of Genomics to science and society at large.

## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).
The case study is currently being developed most likely as a PDF file with a modular format. The modules can be utilized in sequence or several modules may be selected as needed to create a project appropriate for various levels of students with varying levels of depth.  

## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).
Within the case study format student will be expected 

## Future Work
Optional section. Briefly mention any potential future development plans for the curriculum package.
